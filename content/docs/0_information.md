## History

The first attempts to develop our own DI for pet projects written on the Flutter SDK were started at the  start of 2020.

Several reasons prompted me to take this step:

1. At that time, I did not find DI in pub.dev with the ability to divide the container into scope (perhaps I was looking badly)
2. Simplify working with dependencies in the project
3. Desire to write your own DI
4. Have a simple DI in your arsenal (hopefully with a simple API)



## Library's features:

DI container's main features:
 - Initialization instance with name
 - Initialization instance when singleton
 - Separate container to scopes
